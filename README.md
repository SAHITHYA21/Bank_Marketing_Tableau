# Bank_Marketing_Tableau
The visuals and dashboard provide a valuable visual for understanding the dynamics of how bank marketing campaigns and customer details affect term deposits subscription.

## Visuals Description:

1. **Stacked Bar Chart:** This stacked bar chart illustrates the distribution of customers across different job types, categorized by whether they purchased a term deposit. It reveals which professions have a higher tendency to subscribe to term deposits. The conversion rates can be improved by investigating reasons for lower conversion rates in specific job types (e.g., blue-collar) and considering targeted campaigns or product adjustments to address these segments.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45c5457b-afc9-4873-9b00-113128b89bfb)
   
2. **Line Chart 1:** The two line charts representing term deposit purchase count (blue) and balance (green) across different age groups provide insights into how balance and term deposit purchases are related. It is observed that customers with the age range 25-40 have purchased and have high balance which indicates that purchase count has positive correlation with balance. Purchases can be increased by focusing marketing efforts on age groups with higher average balances and lower purchase rates i.e., 45-60. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ac18d63-4666-4d26-8538-92887f2d3112)

3. **Horizontal Chart:** The chart reveals that education level and marital status influence the propensity to purchase term deposits. The varying lengths of the bars indicate differences in the number of purchased term deposits across different combinations of education and marital status. It is observed that customers with only primary education have purchased less compared to customers with higher education. So, by conducting financial education programs to customers we can increase their understanding of term deposits and their benefits. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f85b8394-3899-4ce5-8a9b-8e25caef18ab)

4. **Line Chart 2:** The chart reveals fluctuations in the number of term deposits over last contact date, with peaks and troughs indicating periods of high and low activity along with forecasting. The comparison between the "Actual" and "Estimate" lines provides insights into the accuracy of the forecasting model. The forecast is uncertain since there was no contact in September 2017 and were large variations in 2018.  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d2147776-71fc-4f15-a62d-7ba3e589a70c)

5. **Table 1:** The table illustrates how the duration of contact and number of contacts performed during this campaign influences the likelihood of a purchase of term deposit. It is noticed that even though the number of times contacts performed and duration of call during campaign is less in year 2018 compared to 2017, more clients have subscribed to term deposit. This behavior might be because clients were not sure about the program (term deposit purchase) in the initial days of campaign. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2308400-8068-443b-b23e-e3f4fdf95ce8)

6. **Table with indicators 2:** The table reveals changes in the preferred contact method (cellular, telephone, unknown) over the years affect term deposit subscriptions. The significant increase in cellular contacts from 2017 to 2018 indicates a growing preference for mobile communication. The decrease in telephone and unknown contacts suggests a shift away from traditional communication channels. Given the increasing popularity of cellular contacts, prioritize marketing campaigns through SMS, apps, or other mobile channels. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4056e7f-eb21-4291-84b6-0b821ffcf286)

Also provides the predictive analysis (forecasting) of what will be the term deposit purchase count based on past data related to campaign. Key trends include an increase in term deposits in 2018 and a correlation between customer contact frequency and deposit rates.
